While everything should use RxPy for communication, lets add a datahandler that stores all the data in a single
    location in a pandas dataframe. It can also be responsible for adding in all the Technical Indicators on every
    tick. In the event that you later split up the program to different machines / containers, you can just add this to
    each machine / container, or as an API somewhere (the you could also store it to a db)

Alternatively you could have it calculate the indicators on the fly through the use of decorator functions which could
    add functionality to the base class
